The film follows Ganesh, a young man with phasmophobia, who gets possessed by Muniyandi "Muni" who tries to kill Dhandapani after he tricked and killed him.

Muni released on 9 March 2007 along with a Telugu dubbed version of same name and gained positive reviews and huge box office collections.[1]

Plot
Ganesh, a young man with a deep fear of ghosts who refuses go out after 6PM, moves into a new house with his mother, father, and wife Priya. All of a sudden, Ganesh is possessed by a ghost and starts behaving in a rude manner; his family cannot understand his behaviour, so they seek the help of a priest named Andaiyar. Andaiyar asks the ghost about his past. The ghost says that he is Muniyaandi and starts revealing his flashback.

Muni was a kindhearted but poor man living in the slums with his daughter. His friend is MLA Marakka Dhandapani, who uses Muni to win local elections and promises that he would give lands to the poor villagers. Dhandapani wins the election but cheats Muni. Muni fights with Dhandapani, who kills Muni and his daughter. Dhandapani lies to the poor people by saying that Muni and his daughter fled with the money that he had given Muni for the welfare of the villagers.

After hearing muni's story Ganesh feels sorry for him and decides to help him, Ganesh requests andaiyar to lie to his family that ghost has left and andaiyar agrees. Ganesh now possessed by Muni manages to get job as a bodyguard for Dhandapani's daughter but after he brutally kills Dhandapani's brother dhandapani finds out that Ganesh is Muni and hires an exorcist named Mastaan Bhai to save himself. Bhai captures Muni and bargains with him, who agrees to let Dhandapani go if he repents and helps the poor villagers. In the climax, at Ayyanaar temple, Dhandapani confesses to the people that he killed Muni and his daughter. He then leaves money with the villagers. Muni talks with the people and eats the feast prepared by them. Bhai tells Muni to leave Ganesh's body, and he does. However, Dhandapani lied and was planning to get back all his money from the villagers. Ganesh, upon hearing this, kills Dhandapani. Bhai sees this act but does nothing, as he finally sees the injustice done by Dhandapani.

Reception
Sify wrote, "On the whole, Muni does not make for great horror film. At best it provides some funny comedy time!!".[4] IndiaGlitz.com wrote, "Larencce has packaged the end product with the right elements. It is certainly a colourful treat for the audience".[5] Behindwoods wrote, "Muni is not a movie that you cannot afford to give a miss. It’s not a classic but it is different, daringly and scaring".[6]
